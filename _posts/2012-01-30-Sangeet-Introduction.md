Dear Friend,

The day that Mahi & Aniket get united in a blissful union is approaching fast. We would be very grateful if you could join us in our intimate family functions to celebrate the occasion. 

> The *Sangeet* is on 3rd of March from 7 to 11PM at the [NTRO Mess, Ghitorni](https://goo.gl/maps/K5Bs81UAD2w).

> The *Shaadi* is on 4th of March from 10AM to 12PM at [Shankar Vidya Kendra Temple, Vasant Vihar](https://goo.gl/maps/6BBxiCgRVzr). The *Shaadi* will be followed by a lunch at the temple.

The map and other details are given below. Looking forward to seeing you there.

<!-- We do hope you have also the Invitation for the wedding reception.  -->

Jayashree & KM
