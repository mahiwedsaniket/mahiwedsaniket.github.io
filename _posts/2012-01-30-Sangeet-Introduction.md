Dear friends & family, 

The day that Mahi & Aniket get united in a blissful union is approaching fast. We would be very grateful if you could join us in our intimate family functions to celebrate the occasion. 

The Sangeet is on 3rd March from 7 to 11PM at the NTRO Mess, Ghitorni. The Shaadi is on 4th March from 10AM to 12PM followed by lunch at the Shankar Vidya Kendra. The map and details are given below.

<!-- We do hope you have also the Invitation for the wedding reception.  -->

Jayashree & KM
