It gives us a great pleasure to inform you that our son Aniket is getting married to Mahi in Delhi on Sunday, March 4, 2018. The celebrations would remain incomplete without your presence. We would like to invite you to celebrate the occasion with us at the Reception at NTRO Complex, Ghitorni, Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road on March 4 from 7:30 PM onwards.

The formal invitations are on their way and would be with you soon. 

With warm regards,
