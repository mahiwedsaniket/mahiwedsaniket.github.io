There are three different elements of the card that we had to carefully think through. Colour, background illustration and text. And the technology that would bake all these elements together. For the background illustration we scoured numerous hand drawn book cover illustrations from the 1950s. Our idea was to search for meaning within the lines of retro book covers. In the age of automated perfection, the idiosyncrasies within the hand drawn illustrations contain messages that took us by surprise. Look closely and you will see the tremble of the hand and the sharp intake of breath as the lines were drawn - something that connects us to the people who sat still and drew these covers from imagination. 

The covers we ended up using are Tschaikovsky's *Fantasy-Overture Romeo Juliet* (1951 cover by Kissane Keane), *More Comic & Curious Verse*, a collection of poem selected by JM Cohen (1964 cover by Stephen Russ) and *Swinburne*, a collection of poems by Bonamy Dobree (1961 cover by Hans Schmoller). Yet, there were so many more that got left behind and we wish we could have used.

We decided to bathe these covers in Mediterranean light. We took the colours from the Ochre Mountains near Roussillon, which are very near the place Marie-Camille grew up in. Ochre Mountain's rocks are known for their distinctive striation patterns. The striation are imbued with all kind of meanings, temporal, this and other worldly. The realisation of the design is inspired in part by the solidity of the colours in Matisse's *Cut Outs* series and in part by the text. And for the text, we took inspiration from our favourite poet. For us, all paths to Ithaca go through Khalil Gibran.    



<!-- Designing the card has been a labour of love for us over the last six months. We have spent an inordinate amount of time meticulously researching various elements of the card. The objective has been to create a card that is evocative of who we are as a couple. -->

<!-- We tried to evoke an emotion in you through very careful use of colours. The cards is splashed with two colours, layered to represent the earth as it folds into the past and emerges anew with the passage of time. The colours hints towards the relationship between individual and collective. As far as we can reflect, there were two main influences for us. First is the colours of Ochre mountain near Roussillon. Marie-Camille grew up near Roussillon and these colours appeal to her in a very primal sense.  -->
