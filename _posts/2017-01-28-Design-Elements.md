There are three different elements of the card that we had to carefully think through. Colour, background illustration and text. And the technology that would bake all these elements together. We took the colours from the Ochre Mountains near Roussillon, very near where Marie-Camille grew up. For the background illustration we scoured the hand drawn book cover illustrations from the 1950s. And for the text, we took inspiration from our favourite poet. 



<!-- Designing the card has been a labour of love for us over the last six months. We have spent an inordinate amount of time meticulously researching various elements of the card. The objective has been to create a card that is evocative of who we are as a couple. -->

<!-- We tried to evoke an emotion in you through very careful use of colours. The cards is splashed with two colours, layered to represent the earth as it folds into the past and emerges anew with the passage of time. The colours hints towards the relationship between individual and collective. As far as we can reflect, there were two main influences for us. First is the colours of Ochre mountain near Roussillon. Marie-Camille grew up near Roussillon and these colours appeal to her in a very primal sense.  -->
