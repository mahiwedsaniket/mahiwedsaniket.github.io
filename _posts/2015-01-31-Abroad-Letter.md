Dear Guest,

To travel to India, you need to get yourself an e-visa. You will find useful information to apply for the visa [this website](https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html). You have fill out an online form [online form](https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/Registration) for the e-Visa, which is available here. Once you submit the form, you would get an email back saying that you visa has been approved. You need to go and then check back online that your visa has been approved. You also need to print out the e-Visa confirmation and present it at the immigration desk at Delhi airport when you arrive.

The form is a bit troublesome but, fear not. Marie-Camille, a vetran when it comes to applying for Indian e-visas have written out the cheatsheet below. Hope it helps.

It is important to apply for the visa *at least one week before you are travelling*. Once you have completed the form, it takes the authorities 72 hours to process the e-visa. Hence, it is best to apply at the very least least a week before you are travelling.

Thank you very much for making it to our wedding. We really really appreciate the length you would have travelled to get there. Hopefully, once you get there, it is going to be worth it.

Best wishes, 
Marie-Camille and Aniket
