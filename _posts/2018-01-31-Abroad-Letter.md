Dear Guest,

To travel to India, you need to get yourself an e-visa. You can apply for the visa on the following website: [https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html](https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html).

The form is a bit troublesome but, fear not. Marie-Camille, a vetran when it comes to applying for e-visas have written out the cheatsheet below. Hope it helps.

It is important to apply for the visa *at least one week before you are travelling*. Once you have completed the form, it takes the authorities 72 hours to process the e-visa. Hence, it is best to apply at the very least least a week before you are travelling.

Thank you very much for making it to our wedding. We really really appreciate the length you would have travelled to get there. Hopefully, once you get there, it is going to be worth it.

Best wishes, 
Marie-Camille and Aniket
