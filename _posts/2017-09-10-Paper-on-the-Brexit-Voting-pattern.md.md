This pieces interprets the results of a new paper on UK's vote to leave the European Union.

There is a new paper by [Sascha Becker, Thiemo Fetzer and Dennis Novy](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/centres/cage/manage/publications/305-2016_becker_fetzer_novy.pdf) at the Warwick University that studies the voting pattern in the EU referendum held on 23rd June 2016. The paper analyses the vote and turnout share in 380 local authorities in the United Kingdom and finds that voter's their poverty and lack of education could explain whether people voted for Brexit or not. Conversely, it found that voters exposure to immigration and trade with EU did not explain whether they voted for Brexit or not. That means that the people who voted to leave the EU did not necessarily live in high immigration areas or areas which were exposed to trade with EU.

Here the interpretation of the result is critical. The paper is able to show the tangible circumstances as they existed for voters when they voted. Taking a leap from there and attributing the voting intentions from that is speculative. Whether the people who voted for Brexit thought that immigration in the rest of the country was the cause of their misery is something that the paper is not able to show. It is an interesting academic issue for social scientists: what can you measure and what does what you measure actually mean. Find tangible variables is the relatively easy problem. Interpreting it and attributing it the difficult problem.
