Music has always played and extremely important role in both our lives. Marie-Camille lives to dance and Aniket grew up listening to his grandfather pick up and strum his sitar every night. And if you have ever met Aniket's mother, you know that given half an opportunity, she literally drops everything at hand and breaks out into a song,  

Both of us decided that we would take an active part in creating the right tone for the wedding by creating our own music. What started as an fantasy saw us buy DJing software and learning how to mix our own tunes. And in some instances, actually creating new tunes. So, at the wedding, for better or for the worse, the melodies and tunes would be by us. And we welcome bouquets and brickbat in response to the music in equal measure. 

Here is something that we created from scratch. It has a modern beat matched with *pakhawaj* in the background and a range of instruments in the foreground. Hit the play button below and see if you like it.
