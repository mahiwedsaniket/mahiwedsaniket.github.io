> I am a bit of a renegade, constantly trying to escape social labels. I trained as an economist and am now trying to grow up and be a real world social scientist. I have a touch of radical and a touch of pragmatist within me. Don't trust me, just read me.

>> Currently, I am  a Research Fellow in Economics of Built Environment at the [The Bartlett School](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/construction/) at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). 

>> Before that I was a lecturer at [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk) from 2007 to 2017. At Cambridge, I was a Fellow at [Murray Edwards College](https://www.murrayedwards.cam.ac.uk) and Senior Member at [Newnham College](http://www.newn.cam.ac.uk) and Director of Studies in Economics for both Colleges. 

>> Before that I obtained my PhD at [LSE](http://www.lse.ac.uk) under the supervision of [Prof. Maitreesh Ghatak](http://personal.lse.ac.uk/ghatak/) and [Prof. Oriana Bandiera](http://www.lse.ac.uk/economics/people/facultyPages/OrianaBandiera.aspx). <br> I got my Bachelors at Hindu College and Masters at Delhi School of Economics at Delhi University. Both in Economics.

>>> My research is primarily focused on applied microeconomic and macroeconomic theory. <br> I love teaching and have taught a wide range of courses in my career hitherto.

>>>>  I am enthusiastic about programming, web designs and Argentinian tango.
