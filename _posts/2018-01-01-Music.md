Music has always played and extremely important role in both our lives. Marie-Camille lives to dance and I grew up listening to my grandfather pick up and strum his sitar and my mother break out into a song, given an opportunity, literally by dropping everything at hand. 

Both of us decided that we would take an active part in creating the right tone for the wedding music-wise. What started as an fantastical idea saw us by DJing software and mixing our own tunes and in some instances actually creating new tunes just for the wedding. So, at the wedding, for better or for worse, the melodies and tunes would be by us. And we welcome bouquets and brickbat in response to the music in equal measure. Here is some music that we created from scratch.
